- 👋 Hi, I’m @antonijamatek
- 👀 I’m interested in data science- statistical analysis and visualization of biology-oceanographic data sets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning modelling primary production and light using in situ data from South Adriatic Sea.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding my knowledge in coding of numerical models for phytoplankton, primary production, food webs, and ocean colour remote sensing algorithms.
